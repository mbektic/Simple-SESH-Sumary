# Simple-SESH-Sumary
Generates a simple HTML page from you Spotify extended streaming history just by telling it where the directory.

Example page [mbektic.com/SESH](https://mbektic.com/SESH/)

## Before you start
 - If you want to get a copy of your Spotify extended streaming history you can get it [HERE](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/)
 - I wrote this using python 3.11.6, but any recent version of python _should_ work.

## Options
In the `Config.py` file you can find configuration options and alter these options to your liking.

- `PLAYTIME_MODE = True`
  - How you want to rank the songs.
    -  True: Ranked on how long you time listened to each Artist/Song/Album. 
       - When True, the script ignores the `MIN_MILLISECONDS` value.
    - False: Ranked on how many times you listened to each Artist/Song/Album.

- `MIN_MILLISECONDS = 20000`
  - Minimum number of milliseconds that you listened to the song.
  - Changing this will drastically alter the final counts.

- `INPUT_DIR = "sesh"`
  - Directory, or folder, on your computer where your Spotify json files are located.
  - Easiest method is to just put them in the sesh folder.

- `OUTPUT_FILE = "summary.html"`
  - Name/path of the output file. If you don't change this it will be in the same folder
  - as this script with the name summary.html

- `ITEMS_PER_PAGE = 10`
  - The number of items per table page.

## Running
 - Just run the script using `python.exe .\GenerateHTMLSummary.py`  
   - You should see the response `âœ… HTML report generated: summary.html`
 - After that just open the `summary.html` file or whatever you named it

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- When you first open the html page it will take a few seconds to render pagination (the multiple pages for tables). Just wait until you see the page update and everything will work smoothly.
- The resulting `summary.html` file can be shared without any of the other scripts or style files as it is all built into it.
- None of your data ever leaves your system or is uploaded anywhere, this all stays on your machine.
